### Add a Foursquare venue to your Flickr photo

This extension allows you to choose a Foursquare venue to associate with your Flickr photo, similar to the Flickr iPhone app.

For the flickr venue icon to show up, the photo must be your photo and geotagged when the page loads.

If you geotag it after the page has already loaded, you must refresh the page.
